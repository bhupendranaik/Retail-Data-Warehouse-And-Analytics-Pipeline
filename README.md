# ðŸ›’ Retail-Data-Warehouse-And-Analytics-Dashboard
A cloud-based retail data solution that automates the end to end flow of data from ingestion and transformation using AWS services (S3, Lambda, Glue) to warehousing in Amazon Redshift and interactive reporting with Power BI.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates a cloud-based **retail data pipeline** using *AWS Services*. It automates the **ingestion**, **transformation**, **storage**, and **visualization** of retail sales data for reporting and analytics.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

1. **Input S3 Bucket**  
   Raw retail CSV files are uploaded here.

2. **AWS Lambda**  
   Triggers a Glue job whenever a new file is uploaded to the input S3 bucket.

3. **AWS Glue Job**  
   Transforms raw CSV into structured *Parquet* format.

4. **Output S3 Bucket**  
   Stores the processed Parquet files.

5. **Amazon Redshift**  
   Loads structured data from the output S3 bucket for analysis using the COPY command or Glue Redshift connector.

6. **Power BI**  
   Connects to Redshift (via Redshift ODBC or Athena ODBC) to visualize and explore retail metrics.
